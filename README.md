# Weather-Applet
Project Summary

The applet scrapes the weather from www.accuweather.com. Made up of 3 classes. Weather, GUI, Run. Weather is where the scraping occurs, GUI contains the instructions on the display and centering the text and the window onto the middle of your screen. The Run class, simply just initializes Weather and GUI. I'm happy with how simple it is, I wasn't looking to create a replacement. I do however actually use the applet quite frequently whenever I'm on my laptop and want to know the weather.

Project Background

This is a small project I decided to do because I wanted to learn how to scrape from a website. I found the Jsoup API and watched a tutorial showing me how to scrape movie titles and their rating from IMDb.
